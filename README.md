# Visual Odometry

![Camera Tracking](./readme/camera_tracking.png)

This repository provides a modular, Python-based implementation of visual odometry that combines state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with classical geometry. It integrates RAFT-based optical flow and stereo disparity methods with SVD-based camera pose estimation (via the Kabsch algorithm). My little R&D in autonomous navigation and computer vision.
